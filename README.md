# Naive-Bees-DeepLearning-with-Images
Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. 

In this project, will build a simple deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees, then load a pre-trained model for evaluation. will use keras, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and numpy, among other popular Python libraries. 

This is one of projects in deeplearning on DataCamp website: https://www.datacamp.com/projects/555
